# Noise and Abstract Art in Python

This library is not complete. I add new art or noise functions as I need to. Packing is NOT optimal. Perlin Noise is most likely NOT optimal. If you want them to be optimal and fast, do not use Python. I implemented them to see how they were made and since the information is very scarce with not many implementations in Python, I'm sharing it.
